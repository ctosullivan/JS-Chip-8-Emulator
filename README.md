# Chip-8 Emulator

This project was made to learn about Chip-8 and basic emulation by following Eric Grandt's excellent freeCodeCamp tutorial - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/creating-your-very-own-chip-8-emulator/ | https://github.com/ericgrandt/chip8-emulator

# How to Run

```sh
gh repo clone ctosullivan/JS-Chip-8-Emulator
python3 -m http.server
```

The rom to be loaded should be saved in a roms/ folder and the rom name is currently hard-coded in the chip.js script

You may need to change autoplay settings on Chrome for sound to work correctly: https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay
